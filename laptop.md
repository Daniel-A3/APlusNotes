* Laptop Hardware
* Laptop Displays
* Laptop Features

------------------------------------
### Section 1 : Hardware
------------------------------------


#### Laptop Storage

 - Laptops usually use HDDs(Hard Drives), SSDs(Solid State Drives) and SSHDs(Solid State Hybrid Drives).

 - SSDs usually come in the form factor of 2.5 inches and 1.8 inches, they are by far the fastest and 
 have no moving parts as they take advantage of flash memory. They are also silent and have low latency.

 - SSHDs are a hybrid between HDDs and SSDs, this means you can get the benefits and speed of flash storage
 while also having a lower price due to hard drive storage.
 - The SSD part usually caches the hard drive data.

 - HDDs have the cheapest price and can store a lot of data for a low price, however they are less robust and reliable as they have moving parts, so they can get worn out. Also they are much slower.

 - Laptop storage is usually accessed by taking off the back cover.

 #### Laptop Memory

 - Laptops have smaller memory. Usually they are SO-SIMM or Mircro-DIMM

 #### Smart Card Reader

 - For extra security, some Laptops have smart card readers for authentication purposes.

 #### Optical Drives

 - Nowadays Laptops are getting smaller and smaller so it is getting harder to find laptops that have optical drives in them, but when they do the optical drives are often removable, can be replaced with other media and can read and write.

 #### Wireless Cards

 - This is used where laptops do not have a wired connection ethernet option. 
 - Laptops will usually have a number of different wireless cards, This can include adapters for wireless connections(__WLAN - Wireless Local Area Network__), cellular based wireless connections(__WWAN - Wireless Wide Area Network__) and bluetooth connections(__WPAN - Wireless Personal Area Network__).
 - They usually use mini PCI or mini PCI express.

 #### Video Cards (GPUs)

 - GPUs are mostly __built into the laptops processor or system board__ as there is limited space, this is very limited and not upgradable.
 - However some laptops have upgradable video cards, however they will not be slim.

 #### LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) Screen

 - Light and high-resolution, very *fragile*.

 #### Power

 - Laptops are powered with Direct Current through the DC jack, and usually come with AC adapters so that you can charge your laptop using mains electricity.
 - The input voltage is usually *110 volts or 220 volts*.
 - Laptops are very specific so its useful to make sure a power supply is compatible with your laptop 
 before buying one.

 #### Laptop Batteries

 - Most laptops use __Lithium ion batteries__.
 - Every time you *charge the battery, you slightly diminish the capacity*.
 - Very specific and has different form-factors for each laptops. Different laptop model batteries may not be compatible with each other.

 #### Touchpad

 - A touch pad is included, this is to aid in the compactness of the laptop and allow normal usage when the user does not have a mouse at hand.

 #### Laptop Frame

 - Usually plastic, this is to make it __lightweight, mobile, durable and inexpensive__.
 - Some laptops have a metal frame, this is more durable than plastic however it can be more difficult to repair.

 #### Speakers

 - Self-containted in the laptop. Usually not of the highest quality and are stereo(L/R)

 #### Motherboard

 - __Usually built to fit__, different laptop models usually have very different sizes and shapes of motherboards, this also means they don't have the usual rectangle shape that normal desktop computers have.
 - This makes *replacement a hassle*, as if there is a part of the motherboard that is faulty then you wil have to replace the entire motherboard, what adds to the hassle is that most laptop components are attached to the motherboard, so you will have to take everything out.

 #### CPU (Central Processing Unit)

 - Designed for __mobility, low power usage and low heat output__.
 - Usually have a lot of __integrated features__, like a memory and video controller.
 - They are __not very upgradable__ however you are usually able to replace it.
 - The laptop CPUs are often much __slower__ than their desktop counterparts as they need to worry about the size and heat.

 ### Section 2 : Laptop Displays
 ------------------------------------

 ### Portable LCDs (Liquid Crystal Displays)

 - Shines light through liquid crystals. Require backlights.
 - __PROS :__
 - Lightweight, relatively low power and inexpensive.
 - __CONS :__
 - Not good at representing black colour due to backlight.
 - Difficult to replace.

 ### OLEDs (Organic Light Emitting Diodes)

 - __PROS :__
 - Emits light when receiving an electrical current.
 - Thinner and lighter, no glass needed.
 - No backlight needed as the organic compound provides the light.
 - __CONS :__
 - Not quite ready for laptops, the organic materials degrade over time.
 - Decayed images can remain on the screen.
 - More costly and power hungry than LCD.

 ### Laptop Webcam

 - Captures video, usually has built-in camera and microphone.
 - Requires specialized drivers and software.

 ### Laptop Microphone

 - Built-in, useful for video calls.
 - Not good for professional and non-casual use.

 ### Display Backlights and inverters.

 - __LED-backlit LCD display:__
 - LCD display but backlit with LEDs instead of fluorescent.
 - Most new laptops use this.
 - __Fluorescent__
 - Need more voltage and power.
 - Not commonly used anymore. Older laptops use these.
 - Make the display thicker.
 - __Inverters__
 - Some laptops have inverters to convert DC current into AC current.
 
 - To verify if a __backlight__ is working you can look closely with a flashlight to see if any information is actually being shown on the screen.
 - To *fix the backlight* you may need to replace the LCD inverter or the entire display.

 ### Digitizer

 - Allows a pen-like device as graphical input on the display. Becoming more commone on laptops, tablets and hybrid devices.

 ### Touchscreen

 - No keyboard required, but often available.
 - Allows you to use your fingers as physical input.


 ------------------------------------
 ### Section 3 : Laptop Features
 ------------------------------------

 ### Laptop Keys

 - The keys on a laptop are usually compressed to accomodate for the limited amount of space.
 - The keyboard can include function keys that can control the laptops different features. For example managing multiple displays, sound, brightness, keyboard backlight etc.
 - A lot of laptops have a key/button/switch that can disable wireless connections/gps completely.

 ### Media Options

 - Allows the user to stop, play, fastforward media, usually buttons on the laptop, seperate from the keyboard or part of the function keys.

 ## Docking Station

 - Allows you to use an external keyboard and mouse.
 - Allows you to extend the laptop interfaces and functionality.

 ## Physical Laptop Lock

 - Prevents people from stealing your laptop.
 - Laptops include metal-reinforced locking slots which allow you to do this.

 ## Rotating / Moving screens

 - Combine a laptop with the functionality of a tablet.
 - This could include stylus compatibility and touchscreen on the monitor.
