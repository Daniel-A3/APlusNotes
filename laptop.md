#### Laptop Storage


 - Laptops usually use HDDs(Hard Drives), SSDs(Solid State Drives) and SSHDs(Solid State Hybrid Drives).

 - SSDs usually come in the form factor of 2.5 inches and 1.8 inches, they are by far the fastest and 
 have no moving parts as they take advantage of flash memory. They are also silent and have low latency.

 - SSHDs are a hybrid between HDDs and SSDs, this means you can get the benefits and speed of flash storage
 while also having a lower price due to hard drive storage.
 - The SSD part usually caches the hard drive data.

 - HDDs have the cheapest price and can store a lot of data for a low price, however they are less robust and reliable as they have moving parts, so they can get worn out. Also they are much slower.

 - Laptop storage is usually accessed by taking off the back cover.

 #### Laptop Memory


 - Laptops have smaller memory. Usually they are SO-SIMM or Mircro-DIMM

 ##### Smart Card Reader
  

 - For extra security, some Laptops have smart card readers for authentication purposes.

 #### Optical Drives


 - Nowadays Laptops are getting smaller and smaller so it is getting harder to find laptops that have optical drives in them, but when they do the optical drives are often removable, can be replaced with other media and can read and write.
