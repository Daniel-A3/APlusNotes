 - Laptops usually use HDDs(Hard Drives), SSDs(Solid State Drives) and SSHDs(Solid State Hybrid Drives).

 - SSDs usually come in the form factor of 2.5 inches and 1.8 inches, they are by far the fastest and 
 have no moving parts as they take advantage of flash memory. They are also silent and have low latency.

 - SSHDs are a hybrid between HDDs and SSDs, this means you can get the benefits and speed of flash storage
 while also having a lower price due to hard drive storage.
 - The SSD part usually caches the hard drive data.

 - HDDs have the cheapest price and can store a lot of data for a low price, however they are less robust and reliable as they have moving parts, so they can get worn out. Also they are much slower.
